# 🧠 Depression Dataset Analysis & Machine Learning

This project uses a real-world mental health dataset to analyze factors related to depression and predict the likelihood of depressive symptoms using machine learning models.

## 🔍 What’s Inside
- 📊 Data preprocessing and feature selection
- 🧹 Handling missing values and class imbalance
- 🧠 Depression prediction using Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression
- 📈 Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix

## 💡 Key Files
- `depression_analysis.ipynb`: Full data cleaning, training, and evaluation
- `depression_dataset.csv`: Main dataset
- `README.md`: Project overview
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages

## 🔧 Technologies
`Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Jupyter`
